# Sorting Algorithms 

This project implements and benchmarks multiple sorting algorithms in **C++**.
It allows the user to generate arrays of different sizes and types (random, sorted, reversed), 
choose a sorting algorithm, and see detailed results including **the original array, the sorted array, execution time, and swap count**.

## Project Structure 
- **sorting.h / sorting.cpp** - Declaration and Implementation of 6 sorting algorithms
- **helperfuncs.h / helperfuncs.cpp** - Swap, Print Array, Generate Array, Benchmark
- **main.cpp** - User Interface (algorithm and array selection, displaying results)

## Implemented Algorithms 
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort 
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort 

## What I learned 

While building this project I learned:

- How to implement and compare multiple sorting algorithms in C++
- How to use the <chrono> library to measure execution time accurately 


## Future Improvements

- Convert sorting algorithms and helper functions into **C++ templates** to support multiple data types
- Add more sorting algorithms 
- Improve user interface
